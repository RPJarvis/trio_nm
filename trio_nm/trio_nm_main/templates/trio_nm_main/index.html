                Our nation has asserted a commitment to providing educational opportunity for all
                Americans regardless of race, ethnic background or economic circumstance. In support
                of this commitment, Congress established a series of programs to help low-income
                Americans enter college, graduate and move on to participate more fully in America's
                economic and social life. These Programs are funded under Title IV of the Higher Education
                Act of 1965 and are referred to as the TRIO Programs (initially just three programs).
                While student financial aid programs help students overcome financial barriers to higher
                education, TRIO programs help students overcome class, social and cultural barriers to
                higher education.</p>
